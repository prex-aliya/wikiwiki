<h1 id="example">Example</h1>
<p>This is an example of a post</p>
<h1 id="syntax">Syntax</h1>
<h2 id="two-spaces">Two spaces</h2>
<p>Try to have two returns, or lines, between two Main headers of the same type. For example before Syntax header</p>
<h2 id="continued-two-spaces">Continued Two spaces</h2>
<p>As seen above two spaces</p>
<h2 id="eof">EOF</h2>
<p>At the end of the file you need to do two things, but the vim thing, and add a reason for you doing this, and if there was a conversation about appending or modifying the page put it there. So people can trace and see the reasons for the changes, for future.</p>
