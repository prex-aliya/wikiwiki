# Example

This is an example of a post


# Syntax

## Two spaces

Try to have two returns, or lines, between two Main headers of
the same type. For example before Syntax header


## Continued Two spaces

As seen above two spaces


## EOF 

At the end of the file you need to do two things, but the vim
thing, and add a reason for you doing this, and if there was a
conversation about appending or modifying the page put it there.
So people can trace and see the reasons for the changes, for
future.
