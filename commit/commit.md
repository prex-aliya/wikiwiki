After which either, create a new directory for a topic, or add a file to a
topics directory, if one wishes to add. Or, if you wish to edit a specific
article, then just do so.


# Format

Look at example.md in the same directory as commit.

Some things to keep in mind:
- Two spaces before a title
- Main Title, copy from Home, 72px size
- Add a Summary, with details brackes, and name "summary"
- Add heading to markdown file vvv

```
        ---
        title: "TITLE"
        date: 2023-03-25
        description: ""
        tags: ['desired tag 1', 'desired tag 2']
        ---
```
